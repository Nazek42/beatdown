Making its debut on the American Home Version of Dance Dance Revolution -MAX-, Sandstorm was one of the many licenses that didn't have much to offer. Put together by Darude, Sandstorm is a repititive techno-ish song that you either like or dislike. When I hear the song, I think of riding one of those carnival attractions that play extremely loud music while spinning its patrons at a high speed over a dipping circular ramp. It's a song that pumps me up and makes me feel good (no matter how corny that sounds).

Anyhow, the stepchart I put together, like the song, is repititive. It starts out with just a few notes here and there and then gets you right into the song with machine-gun runs. As the song goes on the chart slightly changes throwing in a few jumps and freezes near the end. My friend actually gave me the idea of having the player turn like in Frozen Ray, so I hope to see that people will find the opportunity to show off here and there. If anyone who downloads the file gets the chance to play it on pad and can video tape it, please send me an e-mail to the address below.
